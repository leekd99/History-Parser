/*
 * History parser for getting the address of the particular pages visited for any site
 * This will retrieve the users history for google chrome as a comma delimitted csv file
 * Then it will take as input the address of the site's main page followed by the 
 * column index at which the address of the particular page is stored in the csv file
 * Since the index can be chosen it'll potentially be compatible with other broswers history
 * given they can get their history in a csv file
